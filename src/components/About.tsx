                    One of my most distinct memories of high school is designing a website for a family business using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. During
                    the summer between my senior year of high school and freshman year at college, I needed a summer job. An exciting opportunity came to me when a close friend
                    said that he was looking for someone to design a website for his family's restaurant. I decided to give the challenge a shot. During this 3-month stint, I 
                    grew from knowing very little about programming to delivering a website that anybody with Internet access could use to view the restaurant menu, learn about
                    the restaurant's history, and leave reviews. I loved the process of writing code incrementally and interacting with the results on a web browser. I also 
                    liked the huge open source community of web programmers and used many of their creations to decrease development time. After this summer, I knew that I wanted
                    to do something related to programming and computers in my future career. So, I ended up choosing computer engineering as my major in college.

                    If you happen to visit the city I reside in (currently Cleveland, Ohio), perhaps we could
                    meet up. We could:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Share a coffee
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Discuss coding
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Plan a day at one of Cleveland's parks
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
