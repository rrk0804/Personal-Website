                    If you happen to visit the city I reside in (currently Cleveland, Ohio), perhaps we could
                    meet up. We could:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Share a coffee
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Discuss coding
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Plan a day at one of Cleveland's parks
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
