                    One of my most distinct memories of high school is designing a website for a family business using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. During
                    the months between the end of senior year of high school and beginning of freshman year at college, I needed a summer job. An exciting opportunity came 
                    to me when a close friend  said that he was looking for someone to design a website for his family's restaurant. I decided to give the challenge a shot. 
                    Over three months, I grew from knowing very little about programming to delivering a website that anybody with Internet access could use to view 
                    the restaurant menu, learn about the restaurant's history, and leave reviews. I loved the process of writing code incrementally and interacting with the results 
                    on a web browser. I also liked the huge open source community of web programmers and used many of their creations in the projecy. After this summer, I knew that 
                    I wanted to do something related to programming and computers in my future career. So, I ended up choosing computer engineering as my major in college.

                    At <a href="https://www.purdue.edu" className="about-link">Purdue University</a>, I developed fundamental skills in computer engineering: programming, 
                    debugging/troubleshooting, software engineering, data science,
                    hardware engineering, and embedded systems. I also took electives to learn and practice soft skills like problem solving, communication, presentation, business writing,
                    teamwork, and project management. In addition to classes, I was actively involved in many student organizations. During my sophomore year, I became a team leader (TL)
                    for Purdue's orientation program Boiler Gold Rush (BGR). In the span of a week, I was responsible for familiarizing students with the campus, providing them information
                    about classes and clubs, and making sure they had everything they needed to ace their freshman year. My excellent team leaders during during my orientation at Purdue inspired 
                    me to join the orientations committee and provide the same experience to incoming freshmen. Other things I was involved in at Purdue are academic research, teaching 
                    assistantships, and Purdue IEEE.

                   My career in I.T. began at <a href="https://www.elevancehealth.com" className="about-link">Elevance Health</a>, a large health insurance company. In my information technology (I.T)
                   internship at Elevance Health, I analyzed the company's I.T. incidents data to find recurring incidents and patterns. I successfully identified the top 5 recurring incidents, held
                   root cause analysis (RCA) meetings with subject matter experts, and proposed preventative recommendations to permanently resolve the recurring incidents. I also created a dashboard
                   for incident management to visualize metrics like mean time to resolution (MTTR), SLA breaches, and number of unresolved incidents to help the company assess the performance of
                   the incident management team. This internship was very rewarding because it exposed me to enterprise I.T. and helped me decide what career I wanted after graduating from college. During
                   the next summer, I was invited back as a software engineering intern. I helped the company build an application to manage security vulnerabilities.

                    I graduated from Purdue in December 2024. After graduation, I started working as a software engineer at Sowfee Health. I am excited to continue my development at Sowfee and learn
                    from talented engineers at the company.
